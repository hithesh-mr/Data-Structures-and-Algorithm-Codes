# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Codes

This repository will contain my LeetCode-focused data structures and algorithms practice. I'll be solving problems in a variety of categories, keeping each solution organized by topic, and pushing the completed code to GitHub as I progress.

## What's here

- leetcode-problems & GeeksforGeeks/ – where individual problem solutions live (organized by difficulty and topic as needed).
- Supporting notes or helper scripts (if any) associated with a particular problem go alongside that solution.

## Goals

- Build a consistent habit of solving DSA problems.
- Track progress publicly so others can follow along or reuse my approaches.
